the density plot of the Population in 2010, the histogram of the Established Year, and the scatterplot of the Established Year and the AssessedValue. First of all, from the density plot of Population in 2010 we can see that there is a majority of populations that are approximately 20000, while those that are about 100000 or 160000 have the least percentages. In terms of the histogram of the Established Year, it shows that the most records came from the end of 1700s to 1800, and there were two declining periods respectively from 1625 to approximately 1775, and from 1800 and 1925. Finally, the scatterplot of the Established Year and the AssessedValue illustrates that there is a weak correlation between these two variables. However, towns established around 1650 tend to have more properties with high assessed values than period after that."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"CdZvJfOr3ziw","colab_type":"code","outputId":"c1dd8a24-55a0-4741-e5fd-57141b6e7132","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1582001559171,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":7971,"user":{"displayName":"Lei

of towns and Real Estate Sales datasets, there are few relationships between each pair of the continuous variables. The ranges of the AssessedValue variable, the SaleAmount variable, and the SaleRatio variable are limited so that there are no particular trends for these variables to be used to predict the future. Neither did the records of the ListYear column have distinct variation. However, based on the three plots I made above, the density plot of the Population in 2010, the histogram of the Established Year, and the scatterplot of the Established Year and the AssessedValue, I got a few insight for these three categories. As for the Population in 2010, we can see that there is a majority of populations that are approximately 20000, while those that are about 100000 or 160000 have the least percentages. So the populations of these towns are mainly at a low level. In terms of the established year of the towns, most records came from the end of 1700s to 1800. And there were two declining periods respectively from 1625 to approximately 1775, and from 1800 and 1925. Maybe there are some historical causes resulting in it. At last, the scatterplot of the Established Year and the AssessedValue illustrates a weak relationship between these two variables. But towns established around 1650 tend to have more properties with high assessed values than period after that."]}]}
