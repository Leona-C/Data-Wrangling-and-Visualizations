# Data-Wrangling-and-Visualizations
This is the first assignment I completed during the data science course in UConn in Spring 2020.

In this assignment we were tasked with analyzing the Real Estate Sales data for Connecticut between 2014 to 2016.

It contains reading in data, merging two datasets, handling missing data, recoding variables, measuring central tendency and variability, 
statistical visualizations, and building frequency and contingency tables.
